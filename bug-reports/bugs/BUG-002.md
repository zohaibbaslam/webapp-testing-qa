Bug ID: BUG-003
Title: Reset App State clears cart immediately without confirmation prompt
Environment: Windows 11, Chrome 144.0.7559.133
Severity: Minor
Priority: Low
Module: Navigation / App State
Status: Open

## Preconditions
1. User is logged in as `standard_user`
2. At least one product is added to the cart (cart badge is visible)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Add 1–2 products to the cart
2. Click the menu icon (top-left)
3. Click "Reset App State"

## Expected Result
A confirmation prompt should appear (e.g., "Are you sure you want to reset?") before clearing the cart, to prevent accidental data loss.

## Actual Result
Cart/app state resets immediately without any confirmation prompt.

## Evidence

## Impact
Accidental clicks can cause immediate loss of cart state, reducing usability.

## Notes
This is a usability/design defect rather than a functional blocker.
