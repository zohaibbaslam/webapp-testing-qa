Bug ID: BUG-001
Title: Checkout form allows special characters in name fields without validation guidance
Environment: Windows 11, Chrome 144.0.7559.133
Severity: Minor
Priority: Medium
Module: Checkout – Your Information
Status: Open

## Preconditions
1. User is logged in as `standard_user`
2. At least one product is added to the cart
3. User is on the "Checkout: Your Information" page

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to SauceDemo using valid credentials
2. Add any product to the cart
3. Navigate to Cart and click Checkout
4. In the First Name field, enter `@@@###`
5. In the Last Name field, enter `!!!$$$`
6. In the Postal Code field, enter `12345`
7. Click Continue

## Expected Result
The application should either:
- Display a clear validation message indicating that only alphabetic characters are allowed, OR
- Prevent submission until valid characters are entered

## Actual Result
The application accepts special characters in the name fields and proceeds to the next checkout step without providing any validation or guidance.

## Evidence

## Impact
This may allow invalid or meaningless user data to pass through the checkout flow, reducing data quality and user guidance clarity.

## Notes
This issue is classified as a validation/usability defect. While not blocking functionality, clearer input validation would improve user experience.
